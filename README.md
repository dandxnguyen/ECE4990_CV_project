# ECE4990_CV_project
CPP ECE 4990 Computer Vision Vol-bot-sort project


Our attempt at reproducing the results of Vol-Bot-Sort; to improve player tracking in a volleyball match where there is lots of occlusion and clustering.

Only our modifcations to the ultralytics model are found in the ultralytics folder.

We forked and modified the dataset to only include player classification. The original dataset can be found here: https://universe.roboflow.com/volleybaii/volleyball-poi
